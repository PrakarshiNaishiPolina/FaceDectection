Face Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe

Face Detection with OpenCV and MediaPipe


This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It processes live video from your webcam, detects faces, and overlays bounding boxes and facial landmarks on the detected faces.

Features
Real-time face detection using a webcam.
Displays bounding boxes and facial landmarks on detected faces.
Simple interface and easy to use.

What It Detects:
Face Boundaries:

It identifies the location of the face in the video frame.
A bounding box is drawn around the detected face.
Facial Landmarks:

Detects key points on the face, such as:
Eyes (positions of left and right eyes).
Nose (tip of the nose).
Mouth (center position).
Ears (approximate positions if they are visible within the detected face region).
Face Orientation:

It can give approximate positions that help indicate face orientation, such as whether the face is tilted or facing straight.
